# crypto-square

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andeemarks/crypto-square.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andeemarks/crypto-square)

A minimal Compojure web-app built for a presentation at [Yow West 2015][1], and providing a basic UI for the Crypto Square solution found [here][3].

## Prerequisites

Currently building on: 
- [Leiningen][2] 2.5.1
- [Docker][6] 1.9.0
- [Docker Machine][7] 0.6.0
- [Docker Compose][8] 1.5.1

## Running

To make deployment and startup of the application easier, the repo for the front-end (crypto-square) is configured to start all the services using Docker Compose.  

To start all the services for the application, run:

    ./docker-compose up

Note: the first time you run this command, it make take 20 minutes to download all the dependencies to run the services.  This is a bootstrapping tax and subsequent invocations should be very quick.

To access the front-end of the application, you need to point your browser to port 3000 on the IP of the Docker VM.  The easiest way to do this is often via a command like:

	eval "open http://$(docker-machine ip):3000"
	
## Browser Tests

To test the app using [clj-webdriver][4] on port 4000, run:

    lein midje

Note: this assumes you have the [Chrome Driver][5] installed at ~/bin/chromedriver
