# square-sizer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andeemarks/square-sizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andeemarks/square-sizer)

A toy Compojure microservice built for a presentation at [Yow West 2015][1].

This service implements a small part of the Crypto Square solution found [here][3].  The granularity of this service is extreme and should _not_ be used as an example of how to pull apart a larger solution into services.
